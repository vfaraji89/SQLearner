# **App Name**: SQLearner

## Core Features:

- Interactive SQL Modules: Display interactive learning modules covering SQL foundational concepts, basic SELECT and filtering, aggregation and grouping, joins, and window functions.
- SQL Editor: Implement a hands-on SQL editor where users can write and execute SQL queries against a mock database.
- AI Query Explanation: Integrate an AI SQL query explanation tool to provide detailed explanations of SQL queries and results to aid learning. The AI is a tool; its goal is to enhance understanding, not to be used for code generation.
- SQL Decks: Create pre-built, engaging 'decks' or lessons covering a variety of SQL concepts, using example queries from categories 1-5 above, for a structured learning experience.
- Example Schemas: Provide example mock databases or data schemas for each category, such as 'clicks', 'bookings', 'users', and 'campaigns', so that users have something to query against as part of the modules or when writing their own queries.
- Commands Assistant: Include explanations of common SQL commands in a separate 'Commands' pane. Display information when user hover over code words.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark slate blue (#483D8B) to evoke feelings of professionalism, trust and knowledge.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0) to reduce strain in the users eyes.
- Accent color: Soft purple (#C3B1E1) to signal that the site/application deals with expertise.
- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif for both headlines and body text, selected for its clean, modern, objective, and neutral look, contributing to a professional learning environment. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent database concepts and SQL functions.
- Employ a split-screen layout, with the learning modules on one side and the SQL editor on the other.
- Use subtle transitions and animations when toggling between modules or executing queries to create a smooth user experience.
