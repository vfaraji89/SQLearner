SQL for Data Products with 100 Examples

This repository contains examples and resources for using SQL to build data products. It includes a variety of SQL queries and concepts, with a focus on practical applications for data analysis and product development.

## Examples

We aim to provide 100 examples covering various SQL topics, such as:

*   Basic SELECT statements
*   Filtering and sorting data
*   Aggregations and grouping
*   Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
*   Window functions (LEAD, NTILE, etc.)
*   Subqueries and CTEs
*   Data manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
*   Database design principles

Each example will include a clear explanation and a sample query that you can adapt for your own data.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can explore the examples in the `examples` directory (coming soon!). You can also use the provided mock database schemas to practice writing and executing your own queries.
